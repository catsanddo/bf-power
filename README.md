# bf-power
A simple (if anything can be in bf) implementation of `pow(a, b)` in bf.

### Specs
There are two sections in the code with labels in all caps.
These are spots for the parameters of your base and exponent.
The program uses 7 consecutive empty memory cells.
It will calculate `BASE` to the power of `POWER` and put the result in the first cell.
(Yet it ends execution on the 7th cell.)

By default this program finds `3^4` (`81`) and prints the result in ASCII (`Q`).
